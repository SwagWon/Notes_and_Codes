# Physics In Energy Range Of BESIII

Lecture 1 at 333 room in Physics Building on 17th Jan at 8:30

## The Standard Model of Particle Physics and its problems

$ L_{SM} $: Lagrangian of SM, a huge bunch of things.

A brief history

Known unknoun: Energy distribution, QCD, electroweak(charmed hadron decays)

## Physics processes at 2-5 GeV and the kinematics

### Events in detector: trigger fired and data saved

$ e^++e^- $ annihilation

Synchrotron radiation

Beam-gas

Beam wall(e-p, e-n)

Beam-beam interaction

Lost beam particles

Electronic noise(junk event)

Nuclear interaction(final state particle + detector)

Cosmic rays(angular distribution, rate)

Air shower

### In BESIII

QED(Luminosity measurement and calibration): 
Bhabha:$ e^++e^- \to e^++e^- $
Di-mu:$ e^++e^- \to \mu^++\mu^- $
Di-tau:$ e^++e^- \to \tau^++\tau^- $
Di-gamma:$ e^++e^- \to \gamma $

Hadrons at continuum:
Continuum production of hadrons
Two-photon processes

Resonances and their decays:
ISR(Initial State Radiation)
Beam energy spread

Cross sections of processes :


### QED Processes Kinematics

Leading order differential cross section for Bhabha:

$$
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{\alpha^2}{4S}(\frac{3+\cos^2{\theta}}{1-\cos{\theta}})^2
$$

Leading order differential cross section for Di-muon and Di-tau:

$$
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=
$$

$$
B=\frac{p}{E}
$$

Muon with small mass:

$$
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=
$$

$$
\sigma=
$$

Leading order differential cross section for Di-gamma:

$$
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{\alpha^2}{S}()
$$

### Two Photon Process($\gamma+\gamma$)

Cross Section (CS is huge but detecting rate is low) :

(eq.Needing)


### Continuum hadron production

Process is similar to Di-muon, but muon is changed to quark and froms hadron.

$$
R=\frac{\sigma_h}{\sigma_{\mu\mu}}=\Sigma_i3Q_i^2
$$

Gluon correction:

(eq.Needing)

### Resonance production

$$
\sigma=
$$

Width? Partial width?

Considering ISR & $\Delta$

### Measurement at Ecm

### Vacuum plarization

### $\Psi'$ Decays

Different processes and its ratio.

* Transitions~82%
* Leptonic decays~2%
* Hadronic decays~15%
* Radiative decays
* (More)

### How often we get a event on BESIII

corssing time ~ 8 ns.

Collision rate: 1/8ns = 125000000 Hz

Event rate: R=640 Hz.

Design of trigger: 4K Hz is enough for BESIII.

### Introduction to QCD

* Accepted theory for strong interaction
* 


## General introduction to accelerator and detector

Matter~Energy
Accelerator provides energy
Detectors observes matter

Higher energy smaller scale

Fixed Target & Collider
Fixed Target: $E=\sqrt{E_{beam}}$
Collider: $E=E_1+E_2$

Many accelerators today

Cyclotron & Linear Accelerator

Synchrotrons

Stuffs, Don't want to copy now.

### Main parameters: particle type

* Hadron collisions
* Lepton collisions

Discovery-Precision

### Main parameters: particle energy

* Larger unprobed energies leads to new physics
* $E_{CM}$: center-of-mass energy

### Main parameters: luminosity

$$

$$

Ways to increase Luminosity:
